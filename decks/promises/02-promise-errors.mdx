## Promise Error Handling 

* doSomethingAsync().then(onSuccess,onError)
* the `onError` will catch errors in `doSomethingAsync` 
* not in `onSuccess`

---

## Promise Error Handling

```javascript
getData().then(function onSuccess() {
    // executes if getData resolves
 }, function onError(errors) { 
     // executes if getData rejects, or throws an error
 })
```

---

## How To Handle an Error If Something Breaks in `onSuccess`?

```javascript
getData().then(function onSuccess() {
    // executes if getData resolves
 }).then(null, function onError(error) {
     // if something fails in getData,
     // or onSuccess - then it will be captured here
 })
```
