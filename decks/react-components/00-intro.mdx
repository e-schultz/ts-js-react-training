## What Will Be Covered?

- Key Concepts
- JSX
- Class vs Functional components
- Props
- Styling
- Composing Components
- Inputs

---


## Key Concepts

- The UI is made up of components
- Components are just JavaScript functions or Classes
- Data is provided to components
- Components drive the UI
- Since the app is data-driven, data should be managed in only a few places

```notes
React is different from jQuery because the source of truth is your components and your application state.
Compare with jQuery, where the source of truth is the DOM itself, and you access it directly.
In React, we work with the DOM indirectly.
```

## Unidirectional Data Flow

- React Apps are data-driven
- Data is passed down with Props
- Events or Callbacks are used to notify parent of changes
- Data drives re-render

---

## React and the DOM

- Internally, React keeps track of a "copy" called the Virtual DOM
- React handles updating the DOM for you when it's Virtual DOM model changes
- It is rare you will need to access the DOM yourself
- Allows for greater speed

# React Components

- Reusable building blocks of the application
- Create them once, use them in many places
- Can take inputs from parent components, called props
- Can be Class Based, or functions
