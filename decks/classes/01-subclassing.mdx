## Mental Model

- Often do not need to create Classes
- Usually for framework specific needs
- Prefer to have Objects that contain data
- Prefer to have functions that operate on data
- Separate behaviour from Data
- Keep the Class hierarchy shallow

```notes
eventual todo: C# class vs ES6/TypeScript class?

## Understanding This and Classes

* Fat Arrow for Class Methods keeps the context of `this`
* But what happens if we are not consistent with this?


---
export default FullScreenCode

## Look at `sayHello () =>`

<ReplIt src="https://repl.it/@e_schultz/Classes-SubClass-starting-point-sayHello?lite=true"/>

```notes
* Both methods are using fat arrow for say hello
* What happens if we use normal methods?
```

export default FullScreenCode

## What if one isn't fat?

<ReplIt src="https://repl.it/@e_schultz/Classes-SubClass-inconsistent-this-binding?lite=true"/>

export default FullScreenCode

## What if we make them normal methods?
