# Styling in React

---

## What we will cover

* Stying React components
* Conditional styling
* CSS approaches

---

##  Stying React components

- You can use CSS the way you normally would
- "Class" is a reserved name in JavaScript
- Apply classes using the "className" attribute

---

## className

```css
.red-title {
    color: red;
}
```

```javascript
const RedTitle = ({ text }) => (
    <h1 className="red-title">{ text } </h1>
)
```

---

## Inline Styling

* This approach should be avoided, but it is possible

```javascript
const RedTitle = ({ text }) => (
    <h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>{ text }</h1>
)
```

---

## Conditional Styling

```javascript
const DropDown = ({ visible }) => {
    const visibleClass = visible ? 'show' : 'hide';
    return (
        <div className="{`drop-down ${visibleClass}`}"></div>
    )
}
```

```notes
* className can be interpreted, so we can combine classes based on a variable created earlier in the block, or even using an inline ternary
* The classnames library can simplify conditional classes https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames#usage-with-reactjs
```
