# React
## Class Based Components

---

# Class Based Components

* Extend from React.Component
* Can manage internal state
* Access to lifeCycle hooks

---

## Best Practice Reminder

Stateful class components should be used when you need them, not by default

---

# React.Component 101 

Class that extends from React.Component, which has:

*  `state` property
*  `render` method 
*  `this.setState` method to modify state

---

## Reading and Writing State

* The value of a component's state is modified using the `setState` method
* `setState` is only available on stateful components
* Component state can be accessed from the `state` object (`this.state`)

---

## Setting State 

`setState` can be called in two ways:

* By providing an object 

```jsx
this.setState({
  items: [1,2,3]
})
```

---

## Setting State 

`setState` can be called in two ways:

* By providing a updater method 

```jsx
this.setState((state)=>({
 items: state.items.map(n=>n*2)
}))
```

---

## When to use the updater?

* If the your next state depends on the current state
* React will provide the current state at the time it is being applied
* When not using the updated, `this.state` will refer to the state at the time setState was callled
* [React setState documentation for deeper dive](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate)

---

## setState is Asynchronous

* Changes to state will not be available right away
* setState's second argument is a callback that can be used to avoid issues with this

---

## Without Callback

```jsx
handleCountChange(value) {
  this.setState({ helloWorldCount: value })
  // This will log the old value
  console.log(this.state.helloWorldCount)
}
```

---

## With Callback

```jsx
handleCountChange(value) {
  this.setState(
    { helloWorldCount: value },
    // This will log the new value
    () => { console.log(this.state.helloWorldCount) }
  )
}
```
