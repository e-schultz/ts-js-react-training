# Component Composition

## The "Children" Prop

- A special type of prop
- This represents whatever is passed inside of the tags of a React component
- Think of it like a "slot" that something can be placed into later

## Rendering Children

## Why is it important?

## Composition

- Components stay flexible when we can switch out their contents
- We can make many small components to use where we need them
- Allows for greater component re-use
